# HTML5-24-Hour-Trainer
Work I composed from a book "HTML5 24-Hour Trainer" by Joeseph Lowery ISBN 978-0-470-44782  yr 2011

Chapters 23-28 dealth with adding video and audio and the given <audio> and <video> elements.  Controls and such were covered.  I am not able to get the html pages to fire up with the audio and video after I moved the "asset" files from its directory. I can only get the pages to work on my local machine as I originally received the directories from the author.
